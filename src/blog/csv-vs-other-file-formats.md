# CSV vs Other File Formats: When to Use What

When it comes to storing and sharing data, there are numerous file formats to choose from. In this post, we'll compare CSV (Comma-Separated Values) with other popular formats and discuss when to use each.

## CSV
**Pros:**
- Simple and human-readable
- Widely supported
- Compact file size

**Cons:**
- Limited data types
- No built-in data validation

**Best for:** Simple datasets, data exchange between different systems

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
**Pros:**
- Supports complex data structures
- Human-readable
- Native support in many programming languages

**Cons:**
- Larger file size compared to CSV
- Can be overkill for simple datasets

**Best for:** Web applications, APIs, complex data structures

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
**Pros:**
- Highly structured
- Self-descriptive
- Supports metadata

**Cons:**
- Verbose, resulting in larger file sizes
- More complex to parse than CSV or JSON

**Best for:** Configuration files, data with complex hierarchies

Choose the right format based on your specific needs, considering factors such as data complexity, file size, and intended use.
